# Let's create a variable

#x = 10 # type of int
#y = 3.6 # float
#name = "Sparta" #string

#print(x)
#print(type(y))
#print(name)
#print(x + y)

# builtin method called type() to find the value of variable
# this is useful if variable is stored in different file etc

# add the variable called x and variable called name and display
# casted int into a string
#print(str(x) + name)

#NHS = 12345 # float
#name = input("please enter your name")
#age = input("please enter your age")

# overwriting a variable
#name = "james"
#print(name)
#name = "bond"
#print(name)

# exercise capturing user details - enter in between the lines

# create a variable called first_name and last_name
#first_name = "james"
#last_name = "bond"

#first_name = input("Please enter your first name")

#print (first_name + ' ' + last_name)


# create a variable called full_name
# full_name = "james bond"
#full_name = input("please enter your name")

# display full name
#print(full_name)

# create a variable called age
#age = input("Please enter your age")

# create a variable called address

# prompt the user to get all of the above info
# full_name = "james bond"

# display all of the info collected from the user
