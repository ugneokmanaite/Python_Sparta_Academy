# Data collection

# Java array- in python lists are same as arrays
# both serve the same purpose of storing data

# Why lists?
       # help manage data
       # help access data in order
       # it gives us the option to add, remove data- IMMUTABLE!

# Syntax
    # using square brackets []
    # () will be tuple
    # {dictionary- key:value}
    # Tuples are immutable - which means they cannot be changed
    # Dictionary will store key values

# Creating a list of cities

# cities = ["Tokyo", "Paris", "Prague", "Munich"]
# display will always refer to print option
# print(cities)
# print(type(cities))
# (It will tell us what type of data it is)

# Accessing Munich from the list
# print(cities[-1])
# print(cities[1])
# print(len(cities))

# Changing Munich to Amsterdam
# cities[3] = "Amsterdam"

# Adding cities to the list
# cities.append("Vilnius")

# Removing city from a list
# cities.remove("Paris")

# For deleting the last index
# cities.pop()

# Inserting via Index
# cities.insert(0, "London")

# Storing different data types in list
# mix_type_string = [[1, 2, 3], ["one", "two", "three"]]

# string_list = ["one", "two," "three"]

# print(mix_type_string + string_list)
