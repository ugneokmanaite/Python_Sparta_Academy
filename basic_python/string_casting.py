# x = 10
# y = 11

# print(x ==y) - checking the value as Boolean resulting in True/False (EQUALS)

# print(x != y) - checking the value as Boolean resulting in True/False (DOES NOT EQUAL)

# print(x >y)

# print(x < y)

# Let's check a real life example now to understand it better

# age = 18

# print (age < 19)

# print(3 % 9) # Modular gives us the left over of the value

# Double quotes VS single quotes in python

# single still works!
# print ('Hello World')

# Using double quotes is better practice
# Example to display this below

# print('Ugne's class is eng 67) This will not work

# alternative
# print('Ugne\'s class is eng 67')

# Easier to just use " marks
# print ("Ugne's class is eng 67")

# Strings --  casting -- slicing -- concatenation
# greeting_welcome = "Hello world"

# welcome_user = input("Please enter your name")

# Concatenation
# print("Dear " + welcome_user + " welcome on board")

# H E L L O   W O R L D
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# -11                 -1
# Indexing - in Python it starts from 0

# This will provide the length of characters
# print(len(greeting_welcome))

# String Slicing

# hi = "hello world"

# print(hi[0])

# print(hi[-1])

# print(hi[0:5]) # to get hello printed
# print(hi[6:11]) # to get world printed

# print(hi[1:3]) # to get el printed

# print(hi[-5:-1])

# remove_white_space = "remove the space at the end o a string      "
# print(len(remove_white_space))
# print(len(remove_white_space.strip()))

# Boolean value within DATA types

use_text = "here's SOME text with lot's of text"
# count() counts the substring within the string
# print(use_text.count("t"))

# All of these are IDEs

# lower - brings everything to lower case
# print(use_text.lower())
# upper- brings everything to upper case
# print(use_text.upper())
# Capital for every word
# print(use_text.title())
# capitalize first letter of sentence
# print(use_text.capitalize())
# replacing text in the string
# print(use_text.replace("with", ","))

print(use_text.startswith("h"))
